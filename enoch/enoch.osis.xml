      <title>Chapter 6</title>
        <hi type="super">1</hi> <note type="x-footnote">VI-XI. These chapters are abruptly introduced. See introduction, vi. 3-8, viii. 1-3, ix. 7, x. 11 belong to a Semjâzâ cycle of myths. As in lxix. 2 he is chief and Azâzêl only tenth in command. Elsewhere in Enoch Azâzêl is chief and Semjâzâ is not mentioned. These myths, however, were already confused in their present form when lxxxviii-lxxxix. I were written. Again, x. 1-3 belongs to an Apocalypse of Noah, many fragments of which occur in Enoch. Syncellus gives an additional fragment of it after x. 3. Indeed, vi-xi is all Noachic; cf. Jub. vii. 21-25, and my edition of Jubilees lxxi seqq., 264. xii-xvi, however, belong to the Book of Enoch.</note> And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters.
        <hi type="super">2</hi> And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: ‘Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.’<note type="x-footnote">Cf. xiii. 8, xiv. 3, .xxxix. 1. See xv. 1-7. Cf ‘sons of the holy angels’ lxxi. 1, and note. The entire myth of the angels and the daughters of men in Enoch arises from Gen. vi. 1-4: ‘the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men.’ This refers not to alliances between Sethites and Cainites, but to an early Persian (?) myth to the effect that before Zoroaster's coming demons had corrupted the earth and allied themselves with women (Bousset, Rel. d. Jud. 382, 560). The original LXX rendering for ‘sons of God’ was γγελοι τοῦ Θεοῦ, as in Philo, de Gigantibus, Justin Martyr, Apol. ii. 5, Eusebius, Augustine, and Ambrose. On the myths see Griinbaum in ZDMG xxxi. 225 ff., and for statements dependent on this account in Enoch, or harmonizing with it, cf. Jub. iv. 15, v. 1 seqq.; Test. Reub. v. 6, 7, Test. Naph. iii. 5, 2 En. vii, xviii, Jude 6, 2 Pet. ii. 4; Joseph, Ant. i. 3. 1; Philo, de Gigantibus; Justin Martyr, Apol. i. 5; Ps. Clement, Hom. viii. 13; Clem. Alex. Strom. v. 1. 10; Tert. de Virg. Veland. vii; Adv. Marcion. v. 18; De Idol. ix; Lact. Instit. ii. 15; Commodian, Instruct. i. 3. In the De Civ. Dei xv. 23 Augustine combats this view and denies the inspiration of Enoch which Tertullian had upheld.</note><note type="crossReference"><reference osisRef="Gen.6.1-Gen.6.4">Gen 6:1-4</reference></note><note type="crossReference"><reference osisRef="Jude.1.6">Jude 1:6</reference></note><note type="crossReference"><reference osisRef="2Pet.2.4">2 Pet 2:4</reference></note>

        <hi type="super">4</hi> And they all answered him and said: ‘Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.’
        <hi type="super">5</hi> Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it.
        <hi type="super">6</hi> And they were in all two hundred; who descended ┌in the days┐ of Jared<note type="x-footnote">see cvi. 13. So the Greek; the Ethiopic is corrupt. We thus get two paronomasiae in the Hebrew: Jared, and ירר ‘descend’, and Hermon and חרס ‘a curse’. For the tradition cf. Orig. Comment. in Ioann. tom. viii, p. 132, ed. Huet.; Epiphanius, Adv. Haer. i. 4, ed. Petav., tom. i, p. 4; Hilary, Comm. in Ps 132:3. The reasons for the angels’ descent in the Book of Jubilees differ from those given in this chapter. There in iv and v it is said that the Watchers were sent to earth by God ‘to instruct  the children of men to do judgement and uprightness', and that when so doing they began to lust after the daughters of men. Cf. Test. Reub. v. 6. In 1 Enoch the angels are said to have descended because of their lust, and the same reason is given in Jalkut Shim. Beresh. 44. See Weber, Jüd. Theologie, 253. The Book of Jubilees has an implicit polemic against this and other statements of Enoch. In later tradition Azâzêl could not return to heaven because he had outstayed the seven days' limit assigned to angelic visitants to earth.</note> on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it.<note type="crossReference"><reference osisRef="Ps.132.3">Ps 132:3</reference></note>

This second vision is given at length, with God's revelation about the Watchers' first estate, sin, and doom, xiv. 2-xvi. 2.

Of the two sources suggested by Beer for the Parables, verses 3-4 thus belong to the Son of Man source, verses 5-9 the Elect One source.

The Deluge and the judgement of the fallen angels are mentioned together here as in x. 2, 4, but here (1) the prison is the burning valley (= the Gehenna of liv, though there it is a furnace of fire that receives the angels), and (2) this is the preliminary prison, not the final.</note>

        <hi type="super">13</hi> Because these waters of judgement minister to the healing of the body of the kings and the lust of their body; therefore they will not see and will not believe that those waters will change and become a fire which burns for ever.<note type="x-footnote">The waters heal now, and their healing virtue blinds the kings to the fire below which is reserved for their future torment.

        <hi type="super">4</hi> And thus she rises. And her first phase<note type="x-footnote">lit.

Again the moon is divided into fourteen parts, i.e. each half surface into seven parts, and the waxing of the moon is due to the successive lighting up of each fourteenth part.

        <hi type="super">11</hi> And the overplus of the sun and of the stars amounts to six days: in 5 years 6 days every year come to 30 days: and the moon<note type="x-footnote"><i>t²,β</i>: <i>ɑ</i> has transposed the word to the next sentence, as subject to 'bring in'.</note> falls behind the sun and stars to the number of 30 days.
        <hi type="super">12</hi> And the sun and the stars bring in all the years exactly, so that they do not advance or delay their position by a single day unto eternity; but complete the years with perfect justice in 364 days.<note type="x-footnote">Accuracy of the solar and sidereal time-division.

        <hi type="super">14</hi> On the side whence the light of the moon comes forth, there again she wanes till all the light vanishes and all the days of the month are at an end, and her circumference is empty, void of light.

Beer, however, taking xci. 1-11, 18-19 as the introduction to the Apocalypse of Weeks, rearranges the order as xci. 1-11, 18-19, xciii, xci. 12-17, xcii, xciv.</note> <note type="x-footnote">The beginning of the new book composed of xci-civ.

Part of this section has been preserved in a Latin Version which I print side by side with the text.</note> And after some days my son Methuselah took a wife for his son Lamech, and she became pregnant by him and bore a son. (Latin Fragment: Factum est autem [cum esset Lamech annorum tricentorum quinquagenta] natus est ei filiu(s) | And it came to pass [when Lamech was three hundred and fifty years old] that a son(s) was born to him.)L

Cf. the Eth. version in v. 5, and v. 10. In the Latin (v. 2) septies seems corrupt for capitis. Cf. v. 10.</note> And when he opened his eyes, he lighted up the whole house like the sun, and the whole house was very bright. (cui oculi sunt sicut radi solis capilli autem eius candi di ores in septies niue corpori autem eius nemo hominum potest intueri. | Whose eyes are like the rays of the sun, but his white lips are seven times snow-white, but no man can look upon his body.)L
