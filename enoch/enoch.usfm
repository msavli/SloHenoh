\ms1 I-V. Parable of Enoch on the Future Lot of the Wicked and the Righteous.
\c 1

\p
\v 1 The words of the blessing of Enoch, wherewith he blessed the elect ╓and╖ righteous, who will be living in the day of tribulation, when all the wicked ╓and godless╖ are to be removed.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Cf. Deut. xxxiii. 1, ' the blessing of Moses.'\f*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Deut 33:1\x*
\v 2 And he took up his parable\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Num 24:3-4\x* and said—Enoch a righteous man, whose eyes were opened by God, saw the vision of the Holy One in the heavens, ┌which┐ the angels showed me, and from them I heard everything, and from them I understood as I saw, but not for this generation, but for a remote one which is for to come.
\v 3 Concerning the elect I said, and took up ┌my┐ parable concerning them:

Cf. Deut. xxxiii. 2; Ps. lxviii. 17. Verses 4-9 all deal with the final judgement.\f*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Deut 33:2\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Ps 68:17\x*
\q1 [And appear from His camp]
\q1 And appear in the strength of His might from the heaven ┌of heavens┐.
\p
\q1
\v 5 And all shall be smitten with fear,
\q1 And the Watchers\f + \fr \reference : \ft Here and in x. 9, 15, xii. 4, xiii. 10, xiv. 1, 3, xv. 2, xvi. 1, 2, xci. 15 = fallen angels. In xii. 2, 3, xx. 1, xxxix. 12, 13, xl. 2, lxi. 12, lxxi. 7 = archangels. The name first occurs in Dan. iv. 13, 17, 23.

\p
\q1
\v 6 And the high mountains shall be shaken,
\q1 And the high hills shall be made low,
\q1 And shall melt like wax before the flame.\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Ps 97:5\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Mic 1:4\x*
\p
\q1
\v 7 And the earth shall be ┌wholly┐ rent in sunder,
\q1 And all that is upon the earth shall perish,
\q1 And there shall be a judgement upon all (men).
\p
\q1
\v 8 But with the righteous He will make peace.
\p
\q1 And will protect the elect,
\q1 And mercy shall be upon them.
\p
\q1 And they shall all belong to God,
\q1 And they shall be prospered,
\q1 And they shall ┌all┐ be blessed.
\p
\q1 ┌And He will help them all┐,
\q1 And light shall appear unto them,
\q1 ┌And He will make peace with them┐.
\p
\q1
\v 9 And behold!

\q1 And to convict all flesh
\q1 Of all the works ┌of their ungodliness┐ which they have ungodly committed,

\v 1 \f + \fr \reference : \ft In ii-v. 3 the order of nature is contrasted with the disorder of man’s world. In Test. Naph. iii. 2, 3, men are told to observe God's law as sun, moon, and stars observe their appointed order, and the Watchers who left their natural order are held up as a warning. Cf. Sirach xvi. 26-28, Pss. Sol. xviii. 12-14.\f* Observe ye everything that takes place in the heaven, how they do not change their orbits, ┌and┐ the luminaries which are in the heaven, how they all rise and set in order each in its season, and transgress not against their appointed order.
\v 2 Behold ye the earth, and give heed to the things which take place upon it from first to last, ┌how steadfast they are┐, how ┌none of the things upon earth┐ change, ┌but┐ all the works of God appear ┌to you┐.

The twelve trees (see my Greek Verss. of Test, of xii Patr., pp. 248, 249) for use with sacrifices have nothing to do with this list here. The Greek has lost iii. 1ᵇ v. 1ͣ through homoeoteleuton.\f* Observe and see how (in the winter) all the trees ╓seem as though they had withered and shed all their leaves, except fourteen trees, which do not lose their foliage but retain the old foliage from two to three years till the new comes.
\c 4
\s1
\p
\v 1 And again, observe ye the days of summer how the sun is above the earth over against it. And you seek shade and shelter by reason of the heat of the sun, and the earth also burns with growing heat, and so you cannot tread on the earth, or on a rock by reason of its heat.
\c 5
\s1
\p
\v 1 ╓Observe ye╖ how the trees cover themselves with green leaves and bear fruit: wherefore give ye heed ┌and know┐ with regard to all ┌His works┐, and recognize how He that liveth for ever hath made them so.
\v 2 And ┌all┐ His works go on ┌thus┐ from year to year ┌for ever┐, and all the tasks which they accomplish for Him, and ┌their tasks┐ change not, but according as God hath ordained so is it done.
\v 3 And behold how the sea and the rivers in like manner accomplish and ┌change not┐ their tasks ┌from His commandments┐.
\p
\q1
\v 4 But ye—ye have not been steadfast, nor done the commandments of the Lord,
\q1 But ye have turned away and spoken proud and hard words\f + \fr \reference : \ft See i. 9, note, and Cf. Ps. xii. 4; Dan. vii. 8, 11, 20.

\q1 And ye shall find no mercy.
\p
\q1
\v 6a In those days ye shall make your names\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Isa 65:15\x* an eternal execration unto all the righteous,

\q1
\v 7a But for the elect there shall be light and joy and peace,\f + \fr \reference : \ft The temporal blessings promised in the O.T., cf Ps. xxxvii. 11, are here renewed, but the writer has forsaken O.T. ground on the question of Sheol and the Resurrection.\f*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Ps 37:11\x*
\q1
\v b And they shall inherit the earth.
\p
\q1
\v 8 And then there shall be bestowed upon the elect wisdom,

\q1 Either through ungodliness or through pride:
\q1 But they who are wise shall be humble.
\p
\q1
\v 9 And they shall not again transgress,

\ms1 VI-XI. The Fall of the Angels: the Demoralization of Mankind: the Intercession of the Angels on behalf of Mankind: The Dooms pronounced by God on the Angels: the Messianic Kingdom—(a Noah fragment).
\c 6
\s1
\p
\v 1 \f + \fr \reference : \ft VI-XI. These chapters are abruptly introduced. See introduction, vi. 3-8, viii. 1-3, ix. 7, x. 11 belong to a Semjâzâ cycle of myths. As in lxix. 2 he is chief and Azâzêl only tenth in command. Elsewhere in Enoch Azâzêl is chief and Semjâzâ is not mentioned. These myths, however, were already confused in their present form when lxxxviii-lxxxix. I were written. Again, x. 1-3 belongs to an Apocalypse of Noah, many fragments of which occur in Enoch. Syncellus gives an additional fragment of it after x. 3. Indeed, vi-xi is all Noachic; cf. Jub. vii. 21-25, and my edition of Jubilees lxxi seqq., 264. xii-xvi, however, belong to the Book of Enoch.\f* And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters.
\v 2 And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: ‘Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.’\f + \fr \reference : \ft Cf. xiii. 8, xiv. 3, .xxxix. 1. See xv. 1-7. Cf ‘sons of the holy angels’ lxxi. 1, and note. The entire myth of the angels and the daughters of men in Enoch arises from Gen. vi. 1-4: ‘the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men.’ This refers not to alliances between Sethites and Cainites, but to an early Persian (?) myth to the effect that before Zoroaster's coming demons had corrupted the earth and allied themselves with women (Bousset, Rel. d. Jud. 382, 560). The original LXX rendering for ‘sons of God’ was γγελοι τοῦ Θεοῦ, as in Philo, de Gigantibus, Justin Martyr, Apol. ii. 5, Eusebius, Augustine, and Ambrose. On the myths see Griinbaum in ZDMG xxxi. 225 ff., and for statements dependent on this account in Enoch, or harmonizing with it, cf. Jub. iv. 15, v. 1 seqq.; Test. Reub. v. 6, 7, Test. Naph. iii. 5, 2 En. vii, xviii, Jude 6, 2 Pet. ii. 4; Joseph, Ant. i. 3. 1; Philo, de Gigantibus; Justin Martyr, Apol. i. 5; Ps. Clement, Hom. viii. 13; Clem. Alex. Strom. v. 1. 10; Tert. de Virg. Veland. vii; Adv. Marcion. v. 18; De Idol. ix; Lact. Instit. ii. 15; Commodian, Instruct. i. 3. In the De Civ. Dei xv. 23 Augustine combats this view and denies the inspiration of Enoch which Tertullian had upheld.\f*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Gen 6:1-4\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Jude 1:6\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  2Pet 2:4\x*
\v 3 And Semjâzâ, who was their leader, said unto them: ‘I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.’
\v 4 And they all answered him and said: ‘Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.’
\v 5 Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it.
\v 6 And they were in all two hundred; who descended ┌in the days┐ of Jared\f + \fr \reference : \ft see cvi. 13. So the Greek; the Ethiopic is corrupt. We thus get two paronomasiae in the Hebrew: Jared, and ירר ‘descend’, and Hermon and חרס ‘a curse’. For the tradition cf. Orig. Comment. in Ioann. tom. viii, p. 132, ed. Huet.; Epiphanius, Adv. Haer. i. 4, ed. Petav., tom. i, p. 4; Hilary, Comm. in Ps. cxxxii. 3. The reasons for the angels’ descent in the Book of Jubilees differ from those given in this chapter. There in iv and v it is said that the Watchers were sent to earth by God ‘to instruct  the children of men to do judgement and uprightness', and that when so doing they began to lust after the daughters of men. Cf. Test. Reub. v. 6. In 1 Enoch the angels are said to have descended because of their lust, and the same reason is given in Jalkut Shim. Beresh. 44. See Weber, Jüd. Theologie, 253. The Book of Jubilees has an implicit polemic against this and other statements of Enoch. In later tradition Azâzêl could not return to heaven because he had outstayed the seven days' limit assigned to angelic visitants to earth.\f* on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it.
\v 7 And these are the names of their leaders: Samîazâz,\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Gen 6:3\x* their leader, Arâkîba, Râmêêl, Kôkabîêl,\f + \fr \reference : \ft ‘star of God’.\f* Tâmîêl,\f + \fr \reference : \ft ‘perfection of God’.\f* Râmîêl, Dânêl, Êzêqêêl, Barâqîjâl,\f + \fr \reference : \ft ‘lightning of God’.\f* Asâêl, Armârôs, Batârêl, Anânêl, Zaqîêl, Samsâpêêl, Satarêl, Tûrêl,\f + \fr \reference : \ft ‘rock of God’.\f* Jômjâêl,\f + \fr \reference : \ft ‘day of God’.\f* Sariêl.\f + \fr \reference : \ft This list is incomplete, as a name has been lost after Tûrêl.\f*
\v 8 These are their chiefs of tens.

\s1
\p
\v 1 \f + \fr \reference : \ft The Ethiopic and Greek vary considerably in this and the eighth chapter. The notes of time in the Greek are due to later hands.\f* And all the others together with them took unto themselves wives, and each chose for himself one, and they began to go in unto them and to defile themselves with them, and they taught them charms and enchantments, and the cutting of roots, and made them acquainted with plants.
\v 2 And they became pregnant, and they bare great giants,\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Gen 6:4\x* whose height was three thousand ells:
\v 3 Who consumed all the acquisitions of men.
\v 4 And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind.
\v 5 And they began to sin against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another's flesh,\f + \fr \reference : \ft One class of giants destroyed another.\f* and drink the blood.\f + \fr \reference : \ft With the Jews a great crime.\f*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Gen 9:4\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  1Sam 14:32-34\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Acts 15:20\x*
\v 6 Then the earth laid accusation against the lawless ones.
\c 8
\s1
\p
\v 1 And Azâzêl taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals ˱of the earth˲ and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony,\f + \fr \reference : \ft [chemical element, Sb, less toxic than arsenic, in large doses causes death within days, use for dye, colouring eyelids. Present use: skin conditioner in ruminants, hardening of lead, preventing materials from burning, in electronics manufacturing films, for the production of artificial polyester fibres and cores, for the removal of microscopic bubbles from glass,...]\f* and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all colouring tinctures.\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Isa 3:16-24\x*
\v 2 And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways.
\v 3 Semjâzâ taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, Armârôs the resolving of enchantments,\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Dan 5:12\x* Barâqîjâl (taught) astrology, Kôkabêl the constellations, Êzêqêêl the knowledge of the clouds, ˱Araqiêl the signs of the earth, Shamsiêl the signs of the sun˲, and Sariêl the course of the moon.
\v 4 And as men perished, they cried, and their cry went up to heaven . . .
\c 9
\s1
\p
\v 1 And then Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel looked down from heaven\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Ps 14:2\x* and saw much blood being shed upon the earth, and all lawlessness being wrought upon the earth.
\v 2 And they said one to another: ‘The earth made †without inhabitant cries the voice of their cryings† up to the gates of heaven.
\v 3 ╓And now to you, the holy ones of heaven╖, the souls of men make their suit, saying, “Bring our cause before the Most High.”’
\v 4 And they said to the Lord of the ages: ‘Lord of lords, God of gods, King of kings,\x + \xo \reference : \xt  [1Tim 6:15]\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  [Rev 17:14]\x* ˱and God of the ages˲, the throne of Thy glory (standeth) unto all the generations of the ages, and Thy name holy and glorious and blessed unto all the ages!
\v 5 Thou hast made all things, and power over all things hast Thou: and all things are naked and open in Thy sight, and Thou seest all things, and nothing can hide itself from Thee.\x + \xo \reference : \xt  [Heb 4:13]\x*
\v 6 Thou seest what Azâzêl hath done, who hath taught all unrighteousness on earth and revealed the eternal secrets which were (preserved) in heaven, which men were striving to learn:
\v 7 And Semjâzâ, to whom Thou hast given authority to bear rule over his associates.
\v 8 And they have gone to the daughters of men upon the earth, and have slept with the women, and have defiled themselves, and revealed to them all kinds of sins.
\v 9 And the women have borne giants, and the whole earth has thereby been filled with blood and unrighteousness.
\v 10 And now, behold, the souls of those who have died are crying and making their suit to the gates of heaven, and their lamentations have ascended:\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Job 5:1\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Job 33:23\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Zech 1:12\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Acts 10:4\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Rev 8:3\x* and cannot cease because of the lawless deeds which are wrought on the earth.
\v 11 And Thou knowest all things before they come to pass, and Thou seest these things and Thou dost suffer them, and Thou dost not say to us what we are to do to them in regard to these.’
\c 10
\s1
\p
\v 1 Then said the Most High, the Holy and Great One spake, and sent Uriel to the son of Lamech,\f + \fr \reference : \ft i.e. Noah.\f* and said to him:
\v 2 ˱‘Go to Noah and˲ tell him in my name “Hide thyself!” and reveal to him the end that is approaching: that the whole earth will be destroyed, and a deluge is about to come upon the whole earth, and will destroy all that is on it.
\v 3 And now instruct him that he may escape and his seed may be preserved for all the generations of the world.’\f + \fr \reference : \ft Gᵍ is much fuller. ‘Instruct the righteous (man) what he is to do, from the son of Lamech, and he will preserve his soul unto life and escape through the world, and from him will be planted a plant and it will be established throughout all the generations of the world.’\f*
\v 4 And again the Lord said to Raphael:\f + \fr \reference : \ft vv. 4-8. Raphael's task – to remove Azâzêl and heal the earth.\f* ‘Bind Azâzêl hand and foot, and cast him into the darkness: and make an opening in the desert, which is in Dûdâêl, and cast him therein.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Azâzêl as the chief offender and leader is first punished (in verse. 11, Semjâzâ), by imprisonment now, and finally by fire. He is conceived as chained in the wilderness into which the scape-goat was led. The Jerusalem Targum (Ps. Jonathan) on Leviticus says that the goat was sent to die in a hard and rough place in the wilderness of jagged rocks, i.e. Beth Chadure or Beth Chaduda (Joma, vi. 8). This Beth Chaduda (='Dûdâêl' of this verse) was a definite locality near Jerusalem. Cf. Lev. xvi. 10, 22. O Semjazi in Azâzêlu glej Targ. Ps. Jon. na Gen. vi. 3, kjer se pojavita obe imeni in je naveden mit. Observe that Azâzêl is punished in a place by himself; and also that in the Noah sections this place is in the valleys of the earth, but in the genuine Enoch beyond the earth.\f*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Gen 6:3\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Lev 16:10\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Lev 16:22\x*
\v 5 And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there for ever, and cover his face that he may not see light.\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Jude 1:6\x*
\v 6 And on the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire.
\v 7 And heal the earth which the angels have corrupted, and proclaim the healing of the earth, that they may heal the plague, and that all the children of men may not perish through all the secret things that the Watchers have disclosed and have taught their sons.
\v 8 And the whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azâzêl: to him ascribe all sin.’\f + \fr \reference : \ft Note how all sin is ascribed to the fallen angels.\f*
\v 9 And to Gabriel said the Lord: ‘Proceed against the bastards and the reprobates, and against the children of fornication: and destroy [the children of fornication and] the children of the Watchers from amongst men [and cause them to go forth]: send them one against the other that they may destroy each other in battle: for length of days shall they not have.\f + \fr \reference : \ft 9. 10. Gabriel to destroy the giants. The account here is closely followed by Jubilees v. 6-11. The giants slay one another in the presence of their parents; cf. xiv. 6, and v. 12 here. The parents are then bound in the earth's abysses, and their power of hurting the earth is at an end ; cf. xiv. 5. But it is not so with the spirits of the giants. They enjoy an impunity in wrong-doing until the final judgement. See xv. ii-xvi. 1.\f*
\v 10 And no request that they (i.e. their fathers) make of thee shall be granted unto their fathers on their behalf; for they hope to live an eternal life, and that each one of them will live five hundred years.’
\v 11 And the Lord said unto Michael: ‘Go, bind Semjâzâ and his associates who have united themselves with women so as to have defiled themselves with them in all their uncleanness.\f + \fr \reference : \ft This verse describes Michael's task, which is distinct from that of Gabriel. Cf. lxxxviii. 3 which is distinct from lxxxviii. 2.\f*
\v 12 And when their sons have slain one another, and they have seen the destruction of their beloved ones, bind them fast for seventy generations\f + \fr \reference : \ft This period has no connexion with the Apocalypse of Weeks.\f* in the valleys of the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their consummation, till the judgement that is for ever and ever is consummated.\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Jude 1:6\x*
\v 13 In those days they shall be led off to the abyss of fire:\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Matt 25:41\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Rev 20:10\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Rev 20:14-15\x* ˱and˲ to the torment and the prison in which they shall be confined for ever.
\v 14 And whosoever shall be condemned and destroyed will from thenceforth be bound together with them to the end of all generations.
\v 15 And destroy all the spirits of the reprobate and the children of the Watchers, because they have wronged mankind.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Gabriel is given this charge in v. 9\f*
\v 16 Destroy all wrong from the face of the earth and let every evil work come to an end: and let the plant of righteousness and truth appear: ┌and it shall prove a blessing; the works of righteousness and truth┐ shall be planted in truth and joy for evermore.

\v 17 And then shall all the righteous escape,
\q1 And shall live till they beget thousands of children,
\q1 And all the days of their youth and their old age
\q1 Shall they complete in peace.

\v 1 \f + \fr \reference : \ft XII-XVI. The visions are only preserved in fragments and are out of order. Cf. lxxviii-lxxx, xci-xciv. As Enoch can still intercede for the fallen Watchers their doom in x is not yet carried out. The original order was: Enoch was asked to intercede for Azâzêl (lost), vision (lost), answer in xiii. 1-2; then to intercede for the Watchers, xiii. 3, xii. 3, xiii. 4-7, vision in xiii. 8, answer to the Watchers xiii. 9-10. This second vision is given at length, with God's revelation about the Watchers' first estate, sin, and doom, xiv. 2-xvi. 2. The closing message of doom for the Watchers in xvi. 3-4 is a duplicate of xii. 4-6, which seems more original. This repetition is very Semitic. Thus the original order would be xiv. i . . ., xiii. 1-2, xiii. 3, xii. 3, xiii. 4-10, xiv. 2-xvi. 2, xii. 4-6 II xvi. 3-4. xii. 1-2 is an editorial introduction. Note that here in this Enoch section a man intercedes for angels: in the Noah section angels intercede for men (ix. 3, 4), but not for angels (lxviii. 3, Noachic).\f* Before these things Enoch was hidden,\f + \fr \reference : \ft 'was taken' Gg, to receive the following revelation. Cf. x. 2. Enoch is still living, and not finally translated from earth as yet. As man he writes the petition for the fallen angels (xiii. 6); receives a vision in sleep, and is transported in spirit unto heaven (xiv. 2); speaks with a tongue of flesh (xiv. 2); and is terrified, like a mortal man, at the presence of God (xiv. 24).\f* and no one of the children of men knew where he was hidden, and where he abode, and what had become of him.
\v 2 And his activities had to do with the Watchers, and his days were with the holy ones.
\v 3 And I Enoch was blessing the Lord of majesty and the King of the ages, and lo! the Watchers called\f + \fr \reference : \ft Cf. xcii. 1. Enoch is really asked to intercede. So read this verse after xiii. 3.\f* me—Enoch the scribe\f + \fr \reference : \ft Enoch is further called the scribe of righteousness (xii. 4, xv. 1), because he is himself a righteous man (xv. 1, lxxi. 14-16) and also declares the righteous judgement that is coming (xiii. 10, xiv. 1, 3, lxxxi. 6, lxxxii. 1, etc.\f*—and said to me:
\v 4 ‘Enoch, thou scribe of righteousness, go, †declare† to the Watchers of the heaven who have left the high heaven,\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Jude 1:6\x* the holy eternal place, and have defiled themselves with women, and have done as the children of earth do, and have taken unto themselves wives:

\v 2 And thou shalt not have toleration nor †request† granted to thee, because of the unrighteousness which thou hast taught, and because of all the works of godlessness and unrighteousness and sin which thou hast shown to men.’
\v 3 Then I went and spoke to them all together, and they were all afraid, and fear and trembling seized them.
\v 4 And they besought me to draw up a petition for them that they might find forgiveness, and to read their petition in the presence of the Lord of heaven.\f + \fr \reference : \ft 4, 5.

\v 5 For from thenceforward they could not speak (with Him) nor lift up their eyes to heaven for shame of their sins for which they had been condemned.

\v 2 And go, say to ╓the Watchers of heaven╖, who have sent thee to intercede ╓for them: "You should intercede╖ for men, and not men for you:
\v 3 Wherefore have ye left the high, holy, and eternal heaven,\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Jude 1:6\x* and lain with women, and defiled yourselves with the daughters of men and taken to yourselves wives, and done like the children of earth, and begotten giants (as your) sons?
\v 4 And though ye were holy, spiritual, living the eternal life, you have defiled yourselves with the blood of women, and have begotten (children) with the blood of flesh, and, as the children of men, have lusted after flesh and blood as those ┌also┐ do who die and perish.\f + \fr \reference : \ft 4-7.

\v 5 Therefore have I given them wives also that they might impregnate them, and beget children by them, that thus nothing might be wanting to them on earth.
\v 6 But you were ┌formerly┐ spiritual, living the eternal life, and immortal for all generations of the world.
\v 7 And therefore I have not appointed wives for you; for as for the spiritual ones of the heaven, in heaven is their dwelling.
\v 8 And now, the giants, who are produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling.\f + \fr \reference : \ft 8-9. The forbidden union of angels and the daughters of men gives rise to a monstrous race of giants, with spiritual powers and earthly desires. So from these giants when they die will proceed evil spirits, i.e. demons, living on earth. Moreover, these demons will not be restrained as the fallen angels are, nor slain like the mortal bodies of the giants. Cf. Justin, Apol. ii. 5; Tert. Apol. xxii. Lact. Instit. ii. 15 regards the demons as wicked angels and no more.\f*
\v 9 Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men ╓and╖ from the holy Watchers is their beginning and primal origin; ┌they shall be evil spirits on earth, and┐ evil spirits shall they be called.
\v 10 [As for the spirits of heaven, in heaven shall be their dwelling, but as for the spirits of the earth which were born upon the earth, on the earth shall be their dwelling.]
\v 11 And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth, and cause trouble: they take no food, ┌but nevertheless hunger┐ and thirst, and cause offences.

\v 1 \f + \fr \reference : \ft 1-6. Cf. xviii. 12-16. The place where the disobedient stars are punished.\f* And I proceeded to where things were chaotic.
\v 2 And I saw there something horrible: I saw neither a heaven above nor a firmly founded earth, but a place chaotic and horrible.
\v 3 And there I saw seven stars of the heaven bound together in it, like great mountains and burning with fire.
\v 4 Then I said: ‘For what sin are they bound, and on what account have they been cast in hither?’
\v 5 Then said Uriel, one of the holy angels, who was with me, and was chief over them, and said: ‘Enoch, why dost thou ask, and why art thou eager for the truth?\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Dan 7:16\x*
\v 6 These are of the number of the stars ┌of heaven┐, which have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and are bound here till ten thousand years, the time entailed by their sins, are consummated.’
\v 7 And from thence I went to another place, which was still more horrible than the former, and I saw a horrible thing: a great fire there which burnt and blazed, and the place was cleft as far as the abyss, being full of great descending columns of fire: neither its extent or magnitude could I see, nor could I conjecture.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Apparently the final prison of the angels here is the abyss of xviii. 11, 12, which was below the waste place, where the seven stars are bound already. For this final prison, cf. x. 6, xviii. 11, liv. 6, xc. 24-5.\f*
\v 8 Then I said: ‘How fearful is the place and how terrible to look upon!’
\v 9 Then Uriel answered me, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said unto me: ‘Enoch, why hast thou such fear and affright?’ And I answered: ‘Because of this fearful place, and because of the spectacle of the pain.’
\v 10 And he said ╓unto me╖: ‘This place is the prison of the angels, and here they will be imprisoned for ever.’
\ms1 XXII. Sheol or the Underworld.
\c 22
\s1
\p
\v 1 \f + \fr \reference : \ft This chapter contains a very detailed account of Sheol or Hades. The writer places it in the far west, as the Babylonians, Greeks, and Egyptians did, and not in the underworld, as the Hebrews. In all other sections of Enoch the Hebrew view prevails. This is the earliest statement of the Pharisaic or Chasid doctrine of Sheol, but here it is already fullgrown. The departed have conscious existence, and moral, not social distinctions are observed in Sheol. See lxiii. 10, for the history of this doctrine. Cf. Dan. xii.\f*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Dan 7:1-28\x* And thence I went to another place, and he showed me in the west ┌another┐ great and high mountain [and] of hard rock.
\v 2 (And there was in it †four† hollow places, deep and wide and very smooth. †How† smooth are the hollow places and deep and dark\f + \fr \reference : \ft This seems to suit only the places of punishment. Contrast 'one bright' and v. 9.\f* to look at.)E (And there were †four† hollow places in it, deep and very smooth: †three† of them were dark and one bright and there was a fountain of water in its midst. And I said: ‘†How† smooth are these hollow places, and deep and dark to view.’)Gg
\v 3 Then Raphael\f + \fr \reference : \ft Raphael has the same role in Tobit.\f* answered, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said unto me: ‘These hollow places have been created for this very purpose, that the spirits of the souls of the dead should assemble therein, yea that all the souls of the children of men should assemble here.
\v 4 And these places have been made to receive them till the day of their judgement and till their appointed period [till the period appointed], till the great judgement (comes) upon them.’
\v 5 (I saw the spirits of the children of men who were dead, and their voice went forth to heaven and made suit.)E (I saw ˱the spirit of˲ a dead man making suit, and his voice went forth to heaven and made suit.)Gg\f + \fr \reference : \ft 5-7. Formerly thought to describe the first division of Sheol, which contains the souls of the righteous, who in their life were persecuted, and suffered a violent and undeserved death. The idea of the righteous or of the angels crying for vengeance on the wicked occurs in all the sections of Enoch. Cf. ix. 1-3, 10, 11, xxii. 5-8, xlvii. 1, 2, lxxxix. 76, xcvii. 3, 5, xcix. 3, 16, civ. 3. Cf. also Rev. vi. 10; 4 Ezra iv. 35. But really these verses describe not a division of Sheol, but the sight of a soul demanding vengeance.\f*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Rev 6:10\x*
\v 6 (Then I asked Raphael the angel who was with me, and I said unto him: ‘This spirit—whose is it, whose voice goeth forth and maketh suit?’)E (And I asked Raphael the angel who was with me, and I said unto him: ‘This spirit which maketh suit, whose is it, whose voice goeth forth and maketh suit to heaven?’)Gg\f + \fr \reference : \ft 6. 7. Abel’s soul cries for "vengeance". Gen. iv. 10.\f*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Gen 4:10\x*
\v 7 And he answered me saying: ‘This is the spirit which went forth from Abel, whom his brother Cain slew, and he makes his suit against him till his seed is destroyed from the face of the earth, and his seed is annihilated from amongst the seed of men.’
\v 8 (Then I asked regarding it, and regarding all the hollow places: ‘Why is one separated from the other?’)E (Then I asked regarding all the hollow places: ‘Why is one separated from the other?’)Gᵍ \f + \fr \reference : \ft The three divisions of Sheol are now given.\f*
\v 9 (And he answered me and said unto me: ‘These three have been made that the spirits of the dead might be separated. And such a division has been made ˱for˲ the spirits of the righteous, in which there is the bright spring of water.)E (And he answered me saying: ‘These three have been made that the spirits of the dead might be separated. And this division has been made for the spirits of the righteous, in which there is the bright spring of water.)Gᵍ \f + \fr \reference : \ft The first division is for the souls of the righteous, whether martyred or not. Thus good and ill fortune in life do not continue even after death, despite 5-7. 'The bright spring' seems to refer to an existing tradition. For the phrase ' water of life ' in Babylonian literature see K.A.T.³ 523 seqq.\f*
\v 10 (And such has been made for sinners when they die and are buried in the earth and judgement has not been executed on them in their lifetime.)E (And this has been made for sinners when they die and are buried in the earth and judgement has not been executed upon them in their lifetime.)Gᵍ \f + \fr \reference : \ft The second division is for those sinners who lived prosperously and attained to honourable burial, having escaped punishment in life.\f*
\v 11 (Here their spirits shall be set apart in this great pain till the great day of judgement and punishment and torment of those who curse for ever and retribution for their spirits. There He shall bind them for ever.)E (Here their spirits shall be set apart in this great pain,\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Luke 16:23-31\x* till the great day of judgement, scourgings, and torments of the accursed for ever,\f + \fr \reference : \ft in Greek, ' till the age', i.e. till the final judgement.\f* so that (there may be) retribution for their spirits. There He shall bind them for ever.)Gᵍ
\v 12 (And such a division has been made for the spirits of those who make their suit, who make disclosures concerning their destruction, when they were slain in the days of the sinners.)E (And this division has been made for the spirits of those who make their suit, who make disclosures concerning their destruction, when they were slain in the days of the sinners.)Gᵍ \f + \fr \reference : \ft The third division is for the sinners who suffered in their life and therefore incur less penalty in Sheol. The suffering unrighteous cry to God for vengeance.\f*
\v 13 (Such has been made for the spirits of men who were not righteous but sinners, who were complete in transgression, and of the transgressors they shall be companions: but their spirits shall not be slain in the day of judgement nor shall they be raised from thence.’)E (And this has been made for the spirits of men who shall not be righteous but sinners, who are godless, and of the lawless they shall be companions: but their spirits shall not be punished in the day of judgement nor shall they be raised from thence.’)Gᵍ \f + \fr \reference : \ft Their spirits shall not be slain. There are degrees of suffering in Sheol. The worst penalty seems to be 'the slaying of the spirit', but even this did not imply annihilation. See cviii. 3 (note), also xcix. 11.\f*\f + \fr \reference : \ft their spirits: + 'because those who suffer affliction here are punished less' Gᵍ, a gloss.\f*\f + \fr \reference : \ft nor shall they be raised: The sinners in the second division will rise, but only for a severer condemnation. Is the Resurrection here general, or only for Israel? If general, this declaration is unique in pre-Christian Jewish Apocrypha.\f*
\v 14 (Then I blessed the Lord of glory and said: ‘Blessed be my Lord, the Lord of righteousness, who ruleth for ever.’)E (Then I blessed the Lord of glory and said: ‘Blessed art Thou, Lord of righteousness, who ruleth over the world.’)Gᵍ\f + \fr \reference : \ft After each fresh revelation Enoch generally bursts forth into a doxology.

\v 2 And I saw a burning fire which ran without resting, and paused not from its course day or night but (ran) regularly.
\v 3 And I asked saying: ‘What is this which rests not?’

\v 2 And I went beyond it and saw seven magnificent mountains all differing each from the other, and the stones (thereof) were magnificent and beautiful, magnificent as a whole, of glorious appearance and fair exterior: ╓three towards╖ the east, ╓one╖ founded on the other, and three towards the south, ╓one╖ upon the other, and deep rough ravines, no one of which joined with any other.
\v 3 And the seventh mountain was in the midst of these, and it excelled them in height, resembling the seat of a throne: and fragrant trees encircled the throne.
\v 4 And amongst them was a tree such as I had never yet smelt, neither was any amongst them nor were others like it: it had a fragrance beyond all fragrance, and its leaves and blooms and wood wither not for ever: and its fruit ╓is beautiful, and its fruit╖ resembles the dates of a palm.
\v 5 Then I said: ‘┌How┐ beautiful is this tree, and fragrant, and its leaves are fair, and its blooms ╓very╖ delightful in appearance.’
\v 6 Then answered Michael, one of the holy ╓and honoured╖ angels who was with me, and was their leader.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Michael, Israel's patron angel, is in charge of these treasures of the Messianic Kingdom. From xx. 7, we should expect Gabriel here.\f*

Gehenna was early associated with the worship of Moloch, repressed by Josiah (2 Kings xxiii. 10), and cursed by Jeremiah (Jer. vii. 31, 32, xix. 2, 6, xxxii. 35). In Isa. lxvi. 24, the rebellious and apostate Jews suffer by fire there, in the presence of the righteous, as here. There are two stages in the growth of the idea. (l) In 1 Enoch xlviii. 9, liv. 1, 2, lxii. 12, 13, xc. 26, 27, the apostate Jews are there corporally and spiritually punished for ever. In xxxvii-lxx, the wicked are to be swept away after awhile. Cf. xlviii. 9, lxii. 12, 13. (2) It is a place of spiritual punishment only, for apostate Jews xci-civ. Cf. xcviii. 3. In the N. T. (e.g. Matt. v. 29, 30) Gehenna is for the wicked generally.

\v 5 And the second was named Asbeêl: he imparted to the holy sons of God evil counsel, and led them astray so that they defiled their bodies with the daughters of men.

\v 1 \f + \fr \reference : \ft This chapter and LXXIV treat of the moon's course.\f* And after this law I saw another law dealing with the smaller luminary, which is named the Moon.
\v 2 And her circumference is like the circumference of the heaven, and her chariot in which she rides is driven by the wind, and light is given to her in (definite) measure.
\v 3 And her rising and setting\f + \fr \reference : \ft i.e. the place of her rising and setting.\f* change every month: and her days are like the days of the sun, and when her light is uniform (i.e. full) it amounts to the seventh part of the light of the sun.
\v 4 And thus she rises. And her first phase\f + \fr \reference : \ft lit. 'her beginning', i.e. the new moon in the popular sense, in the first day of the visible reappearance.\f* in the east comes forth on the thirtieth morning:\f + \fr \reference : \ft of the solar month.\f* and on that day she becomes visible, and constitutes for you the first phase of the moon on the thirtieth day together with the sun in the portal where the sun rises.
\v 5 And the one half of her goes forth by a seventh part, and her whole circumference is empty, without light, with the exception of one-seventh part\f + \fr \reference : \ft gqu. 'of the fourteenth part' mt,β. +'oi half'g, needlessly, as the fractions are fractions of half in this verse and the next.\f* of it, (and) the fourteenth part of her light.\f + \fr \reference : \ft 5-8. The author's scheme is hard to follow. Apparently the lunar month amounts to 30 days and 29 days alternately, and is divided into two parts. During the first part the moon waxes from new moon to full moon in 14 days when the month is 29 days, and in 15 when the month is 30 days. During the second part it always wanes in 15 days. Again the moon is divided into fourteen parts, i.e. each half surface into seven parts, and the waxing of the moon is due to the successive lighting up of each fourteenth part. Verses 5, 6 suppose the period from new to full moon to be 14 days, verse 7 supposes it to be 15 days.\f*
\v 6 And when she receives one-seventh part\f + \fr \reference : \ft ²° gmqu,d. 'the thirteenth part ' t,l. 'the fourteenth part' β-dklo. Apparently 1⁄7 + 1⁄14 of 1⁄2=3⁄28 of the whole moon are lighted the first day when there are only 14 days to the full moon.\f* of the half of her light, her light amounts to one-seventh part and the half thereof.
\v 7 And she sets with the sun, and when the sun rises the moon rises with him and receives the half of one part of light,\f + \fr \reference : \ft i.e. one twenty-eighth. When the waxing takes 15 days, the moon only receives one twenty-eighth part, and so is practically invisible, the first morning: on the second day she attains to one-fourteenth, and becomes visible.\f* and in that night in the beginning of her morning [in the commencement of the lunar day] the moon sets with the sun, and is invisible that night with the fourteen parts and the half of one of them.
\v 8 And she rises on that day with exactly a seventh part, and comes forth and recedes from the rising of the sun, and in her remaining days she becomes bright in the (remaining) thirteen parts.

\v 1 \f + \fr \reference : \ft This chapter deals with the moon's waxing and waning, her monthly change of position with regard to the signs and the sun, and the difference between lunar and solar years.\f* And I saw another course, a law for her, (and) how according to that law she performs her monthly revolution.
\v 2 And all these Uriel, the holy angel who is the leader of them all,\f + \fr \reference : \ft i.e. the moon's phases.\f* showed to me, and their positions, and I wrote down their positions as he showed them to me, and I wrote down their months as they were, and the appearance of their lights till fifteen days\f + \fr \reference : \ft i.e. between conjunction and full moon.\f* were accomplished.
\v 3 In single seventh parts she accomplishes all her light in the east, and in single seventh parts accomplishes all her darkness in the west.
\v 4 And in certain months she alters her settings, and in certain months she pursues her own peculiar\f + \fr \reference : \ft independent of the sun.\f* course.
\v 5 In two months the moon sets with the sun: in those two middle portals the third and the fourth.\f + \fr \reference : \ft 5, 6. During two months the moon sets with the sun as new moon and as full moon. When the sun is in Aries and Libra the new moon and the full moon are in the third and fourth portals. In verse 6 the moon goes forth as it waxes from the third portal to the first in 7 days, turns about and returns to the portal where the sun rises, i.e. the third, in 7 or 8 days, and there becomes full moon, and proceeds thence through the fourth and fifth to the sixth portal, where she arrives after 8 days. Thence she returns to the third portal in 7 days.\f*
\v 6 She goes forth for seven days, and turns about and returns again through the portal where the sun rises, and accomplishes\f + \fr \reference : \ft 'and in that accomplishes' t²,β.\f* all her light: and she recedes from the sun, and in eight days enters the sixth portal from which the sun goes forth.
\v 7 And when the sun goes forth from the fourth portal she goes forth seven days, until she goes forth from the fifth and turns back again in seven days into the fourth portal and accomplishes all her light: and she recedes and enters into the first portal in eight days.
\v 8 And she returns again in seven days into the fourth portal from which the sun goes forth.
\v 9 Thus I saw their position—how the moons rose and the sun set in those days.\f + \fr \reference : \ft a-g. 'according to the order of their moons the sun rising and setting' q,β.\f*
\v 10 And if five years are added together the sun has an overplus of thirty days, and all the days which accrue to it for one of those five years, when they are full, amount to 364 days.\f + \fr \reference : \ft 10, 11. The difference between the lunar and the solar year. The lunar year has 354 days (see lxxviii. 15). The solar year has 12 months of 30 days, or 360, and also 4 intercalary days in the equinoxes and solstices, in all 364 days (lxxiv. 10, 12). In verses 10ᵃ and 11 these intercalary days are neglected, and so the solar year has only 360 days, or 6 days more than the lunar.\f*
\v 11 And the overplus of the sun and of the stars amounts to six days: in 5 years 6 days every year come to 30 days: and the moon\f + \fr \reference : \ft t²,β: ɑ has transposed the word to the next sentence, as subject to 'bring in'.\f* falls behind the sun and stars to the number of 30 days.
\v 12 And the sun and the stars bring in all the years exactly, so that they do not advance or delay their position by a single day unto eternity; but complete the years with perfect justice in 364 days.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Accuracy of the solar and sidereal time-division. Jubilees vi. 32-6 protests against the use of the lunar year.\f*
\v 13 In 3 years there are 1,092 days, and in 5 years 1,820 days, so that in 8 years there are 2,912 days.\f + \fr \reference : \ft 13-16. Merely seem to assert that the solar year of 364 days exceeds the lunar of 354 by 10 days. But why should eight years be referred to? The author seems to have in mind the eight-year cycle or octaetris, which, however, allowed for 365¼ days in the solar year. See special Introduction to lxxii-lxxxii, p. 150 in my new Commentary.\f*
\v 14 For the moon alone the days amount in 3 years to 1,062 days, and in 5 years she falls 50 days behind: [i.e. to the sum (of 1,770) there is to be added (1,000 and) 62 days.]\f + \fr \reference : \ft The totals for 3 and 5 years are added together to give the total for 8 years. (1062 + 1770 = 2832.) The brackets indicate a marginal gloss. (1,000 and) found only in the margin of c.\f*
\v 15 And in 5 years there are 1,770 days, so that for the moon the days in 8 years amount to 2,832 days.
\v 16 [For in 8 years she falls behind to the amount of 80 days], all the days she falls behind in 8 years are 80.\f + \fr \reference : \ft [ ] a doublet.\f*
\v 17 And the year is accurately completed in conformity with their world-stations and the stations of the sun, which rise from the portals through which it (the sun) rises and sets 30 days.

Cf. lxxxii. 5.\f* in the reckoning of the year.\f + \fr \reference : \ft The four intercalary days are under charge of the highest stars, the leaders of the heads of ten thousands. See lxxxii. 11, 12.\f*
\v 2 And owing to them men go wrong therein, for those luminaries truly render service on the world-stations, one in the first portal, one in the third portal of the heaven, one in the fourth portal, and one in the sixth portal, and the exactness of the year is accomplished through its separate three hundred and sixty-four stations.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Men reckon wrongly, by omitting these intercalary days, lxxxii. 4-6.\f*
\v 3 For the signs\f + \fr \reference : \ft i.e. of the Zodiac, lxxii. 13, 19.\f* and the times and the years and the days the angel Uriel showed to me, whom the Lord of glory hath set for ever over all the luminaries of the heaven, in the heaven and in the world, that they should rule on the face of the heaven and be seen on the earth, and be leaders for the day and the night, i.e. the sun, moon, and stars, and all the ministering creatures which make their revolution in all the chariots of the heaven.\f + \fr \reference : \ft These days are, however, real. Uriel showed them to Enoch. Cf. lxxii. 1.\f*
\v 4 In like manner twelve doors Uriel showed me, open in the circumference of the sun’s chariot in the heaven, through which the rays of the sun break forth: and from them is warmth diffused over the earth, when they are opened at their appointed seasons.\f + \fr \reference : \ft The variation in the sun's heat is explained by the twelve openings in the disk of the sun.\f*
\v 5 [And for the winds and the spirit of the dew† when they are opened, standing open in the heavens at the ends.]\f + \fr \reference : \ft An intrusion. The first clause is unintelligible, the second 'when they' etc. seems to be a dittograph of the last clause in 4 and the first in 5.\f*
\v 6 As for the twelve portals in the heaven, at the ends of the earth, out of which go forth the sun, moon, and stars, and all the works of heaven in the east and in the west,\f + \fr \reference : \ft 6, 7.

\v 7 There are many windows open to the left and right of them, and one window at its (appointed) season produces warmth, corresponding (as these do) to those doors from which the stars come forth according as He has commanded them, and wherein they set corresponding to their number.

\v 1 \f + \fr \reference : \ft A detailed account of the twelve portals of the winds and the nature of the winds which issue therefrom. Cf. xxxiii-xxxvi.\f* And at the ends of the earth I saw twelve portals open to all the quarters (of the heaven), from which the winds go forth and blow over the earth.
\v 2 Three of them are open on the face (i.e. the east) of the heavens, and three in the west, and three on the right (i.e. the south) of the heaven, and three on the left (i.e. the north).
\v 3 And the three first are those of the east, and three are of †the north, and three [after those on the left] of the south†, and three of the west.
\v 4 Through four of these come winds of blessing and prosperity, and from those eight come hurtful winds: when they are sent, they bring destruction on all the earth and on the water upon it, and on all who dwell thereon, and on everything which is in the water and on the land.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Through the four portals come beneficial winds, i.e. the middle of the three in each quarter. For the hurtful winds cf. Rev. vii. 1 seqq.\f*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  [Rev 7:1-3]\x*
\v 5 And the first wind from those portals, called the east wind, comes forth through the first portal which is in the east, inclining towards the south: from it come forth desolation, drought, heat, and destruction.\f + \fr \reference : \ft 5-6. Winds from the east, i.e. ESE., E., ENE.\f*
\v 6 And through the second portal in the middle comes what is fitting, and from it there come rain and fruitfulness and prosperity and dew; and through the third portal which lies toward the north come cold and drought.
\v 7 And after these come forth the south winds through three portals: through the first portal of them inclining to the east comes forth a hot wind.
\v 8 And through the middle portal next to it there come forth fragrant smells, and dew and rain, and prosperity and health.
\v 9 And through the third portal lying to the west come forth dew and rain, locusts and desolation.
\v 10 And after these the north winds: from the seventh portal in the east come dew and rain, locusts and desolation.\f + \fr \reference : \ft 10-11. NEN., N., NWN. winds.\f*\f + \fr \reference : \ft MSS. adds a gloss 'which is named the sea and which came forth'.\f*
\v 11 And from the middle portal come in a direct direction health and rain and dew and prosperity; and through the third portal in the west\f + \fr \reference : \ft MSS. add ' which inclines to the north'.\f* come cloud and hoar-frost, and snow and rain, and dew and locusts.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Read perhaps 'what is fitting'.

\v 3 And the fourth quarter, named the north, is divided into three parts: the first of them is for the dwelling of men: and the second contains seas of water, and the abysses and forests and rivers, and darkness and clouds; and the third part contains the garden of righteousness.
\v 4 I saw seven high mountains,\f + \fr \reference : \ft not those of xviii. 6, xxiv. 2, xxxii. 1, though originally they are derived from the same source.\f* higher than all the mountains which are on the earth: and thence comes forth hoar-frost, and days, seasons, and years pass away.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Note recurrence of the number seven in this book, as in Jewish writers generally.

\v 1 \f + \fr \reference : \ft LXXVIII, LXXIX. The relations of the sun and moon are again described as well as the waxing and waning of the moon.\f* And the names of the sun are the following: the first Orjârês, and the second Tômâs.\f + \fr \reference : \ft For Halevy's interpretations of the names see my Commentary in loc. He connects the two names of the sun with the two seasons, cold and hot, in Palestine, and the four names of the moon with its phases.\f*
\v 2 And the moon has four names: the first name is Asônjâ, the second Eblâ, the third Benâsê, and the fourth Erâe.
\v 3 These are the two great luminaries: their circumference is like the circumference of the heaven, and the size of the circumference of both is alike.
\v 4 In the circumference of the sun there are seven portions of light which are added to it more than to the moon, and in definite measures it is transferred till the seventh portion of the sun is exhausted.\f + \fr \reference : \ft In lxxii. 37 and lxxiii. 3 we are told that the sun's light is seven times that of the moon: in lxxiii. 2 that light is added to the moon in due measure. Here we are further told that one-seventh of the sun’s light is gradually transferred to the moon, till the moon is full.\f*
\v 5 And they set and enter the portals of the west, and make their revolution by the north, and come forth through the eastern portals on the face of the heaven.
\v 6 And when the moon rises one-fourteenth part appears in the heaven: [the light becomes full in her]:\f + \fr \reference : \ft ɑ-u. A duplicate of 'accomplishes her light', u is partly untranslatable. β reads in this verse 'and when the moon rises, she appears in the heaven, and has a fourteenth part of her light, and on the fourteenth day she accomplishes all her light'.\f* on the fourteenth day she accomplishes her light.\f + \fr \reference : \ft 6-17 The waxing and waning of the moon, the length of the months, etc.\f*\f + \fr \reference : \ft See lxxiii. 5, 6 (notes) for the case of fourteen days' waxing.\f*
\v 7 And fifteen parts of light are transferred to her till the fifteenth day (when) her light is accomplished, according to the sign of the year, and she becomes fifteen parts, and the moon grows by (the addition of) fourteenth parts.\f + \fr \reference : \ft See lxxiii. 7, 8 (notes) for the fifteen days' waxing.\f*
\v 8 And in her waning (the moon) decreases on the first day to fourteen parts of her light, on the second to thirteen parts of light, on the third to twelve, on the fourth to eleven, on the fifth to ten, on the sixth to nine, on the seventh to eight, on the eighth to seven, on the ninth to six, on the tenth to five, on the eleventh to four, on the twelfth to three, on the thirteenth to two, on the fourteenth to the half of a seventh, and all her remaining light disappears wholly on the fifteenth.\f + \fr \reference : \ft As the moon wanes, her light decreases each day by one-fourteenth part: on the fifteenth the remainder, i.e. one twenty-eighth, vanishes.\f*
\v 9 And in certain months the month has twenty-nine days and once twenty-eight.\f + \fr \reference : \ft a reference to the cycle of Callippus, in which the last month in seventy-six years had only 28 days. See my Commentary in loc., and cf. lxxiv. 13-16 for a reference to the octaetris.\f*
\v 10 And Uriel showed me another law: when light is transferred to the moon, and on which side it is transferred to her by the sun.
\v 11 During all the period during which the moon is growing in her light, she is transferring it to herself when opposite to the sun during fourteen days [her light is accomplished in the heaven], and when she is illumined throughout, her light is accomplished full in the heaven.\f + \fr \reference : \ft The moon waxes over against the sun on the side turned to the sun, i.e. the western side.\f*
\v 12 And on the first day she is called the new moon, for on that day the light rises upon her.
\v 13 She becomes full moon exactly on the day when the sun sets in the west, and from the east she rises at night, and the moon shines the whole night through till the sun rises over against her and the moon is seen over against the sun.\f + \fr \reference : \ft A true observation.\f*
\v 14 On the side whence the light of the moon comes forth, there again she wanes till all the light vanishes and all the days of the month are at an end, and her circumference is empty, void of light.
\v 15 And three months she makes of thirty days, and at her time she makes three months of twenty-nine days each, in which she accomplishes her waning in the first period of time,\f + \fr \reference : \ft i.e. the first half-year. The author recognizes only two seasons in the year; cf. iii, iv. As often as the moon is in the first portal during the first half-year, she is waning; cf. lxxix. 3, 4.\f* and in the first portal for one hundred and seventy-seven days.
\v 16 And in the time of her going out she appears for three months (of) thirty days each, and for three months she appears (of) twenty-nine each.\f + \fr \reference : \ft i.e. the second half of the year.\f*
\v 17 At night she appears like a man for twenty days each time, and by day she appears like the heaven, and there is nothing else in her save her light.\f + \fr \reference : \ft i.e. a human face. Hence perhaps the name Asônjâ in v. 2 (Halevy).\f*

\v 4 And when it fell to the earth I saw how the earth was swallowed up in a great abyss, and mountains were suspended on mountains, and hills sank down on hills, and high trees were rent from their stems, and hurled down and sunk in the abyss.
\v 5 And thereupon a word fell into my mouth, and I lifted up (my voice) to cry aloud, and said: ‘The earth is destroyed.’
\v 6 And my grandfather Mahalalel waked me as I lay near him, and said unto me: ‘Why dost thou cry so, my son, and why dost thou make such lamentation?’
\v 7 And I recounted to him the whole vision which I had seen, and he said unto me: ‘A terrible thing hast thou seen, my son, and of grave moment is thy dream-vision as to the secrets of all the sin of the earth: it must sink into the abyss and be destroyed with a great destruction.

(2) They are to protect the sheep, and only allow so many to be destroyed by the Gentiles. So they cannot be heathen rulers. (3) Men would have been symbolized by animals. (4) During the earlier period God was Israel's shepherd, now He withdraws and commits their pasturing to seventy of his angels. (5) The angel recorder of lxxxix. 61 is called 'another'. (6) In the judgement they are classed with the fallen angels, xc. 21-25. (7) God speaks directly to them. After the exile, Israel was not immediately shepherded by God but by His delegates. How was it that righteous Jews as well as apostates perished? Because of the faithlessness with which the seventy angels discharged their trust, and this faithlessness was to be punished in due time. The theory of the seventy shepherds is an extension of the conception of the seventy years of Jeremiah and the seventy periods of Daniel.

The MSS. evidence goes to prove that the 3rd person was original, for whereas 1g gives the 3rd person in all but seven instances (these are confined to vv. 14 and 15), all other MSS. with few exceptions give the 1st person. Thus the wicked assume the role of the righteous and speak in their person in ciii. 9-15.

These issues only became clear in the Maccabean period, and after the breach between John Hyrcanus and the Pharisees. 'Dispersed' and 'murdered' point to Jannaeus, and the date 94-79 B.C.

Part of this section has been preserved in a Latin Version which I print side by side with the text.\f* And after some days my son Methuselah took a wife for his son Lamech, and she became pregnant by him and bore a son. (Latin Fragment: Factum est autem [cum esset Lamech annorum tricentorum quinquagenta] natus est ei filiu(s) | And it came to pass [when Lamech was three hundred and fifty years old] that a son(s) was born to him.)L
\v 2 And his body was white as snow and red as the blooming of a rose, and the hair of his head †and his long locks were white as wool, and his eyes beautiful†.\f + \fr \reference : \ft The Latin does not mention these 'long locks', and the Lth. is easily emended into ’was white . . . and his eyes were like the rays of the sun’. Cf. the Eth. version in v. 5, and v. 10. In the Latin (v. 2) septies seems corrupt for capitis. Cf. v. 10.\f* And when he opened his eyes, he lighted up the whole house like the sun, and the whole house was very bright. (cui oculi sunt sicut radi solis capilli autem eius candi di ores in septies niue corpori autem eius nemo hominum potest intueri. | Whose eyes are like the rays of the sun, but his white lips are seven times snow-white, but no man can look upon his body.)L
\v 3 And thereupon he arose in the hands of the midwife, opened his mouth, and †conversed with† the Lord of righteousness. (et surexit inter manus obstetricis suae et adorauit dominutn uiuentem in secula [laudauit]. | And he arose between the hands of his midwife and worshipped the Lord who lives forever.)L
\v 4 And his father Lamech was afraid of him and fled, and came to his father Methuselah. (et timuit Lamech. | And Lamech was afraid.)L
\v 5 And he said unto him: ‘I have begotten a strange son, diverse from and unlike man, and resembling the sons of the God of heaven; and his nature is different and he is not like us, and his eyes are as the rays of the sun, and his countenance is glorious. (et uenit ad patrem suum Mathusalem et narrauit illi omnia. | And he came to his father Methuselah and told him everything.)L
\v 6 And it seems to me that he is not sprung from me but from the angels,\f + \fr \reference : \ft The Lat. gives a different idea. Nontius = ἄγγελος. The Lat. of 6 follows 'Lamech' in v. 4.\f* and I fear that in his days a wonder may be wrought on the earth. (ne non ex co natus esset nisi nontius dei. | lest he should be born out of cohabitation except by the messenger of God.)L
\v 7 And now, my father, I am here to petition thee and implore thee that thou mayst go to Enoch, our father, and learn from him the truth, for his dwelling-place is amongst the angels.’\f + \fr \reference : \ft i.e. at the ends of the earth, as in lxv. 2.\f* (dixit Mathusalem: Ego autem non possum seire nisi eamus ad patrem nostrum Enoc. | said Methuselah: 'But I cannot sow unless we go to our father Enoch.')L
\v 8 And when Methuselah heard the words of his son, he came to me to the ends of the earth; for he had heard that I was there, and he cried aloud, and I heard his voice and I came to him. And I said unto him: ‘Behold, here am I, my son, wherefore hast thou come to me?’ (quum autem uidit Enoc filium suum Mathusalem uenientem ad se [et] ait. quid est quod uenisti ad me nate? | And when Enoch saw his son Methuselah coming to him [and] he said: ‘What is it that you have come to me?†’)L
\v 9 And he answered and said: ‘Because of a great cause of anxiety have I come to thee, and because of a disturbing vision have I approached. (dixit | he said)L
\v 10 And now, my father, hear me: unto Lamech my son there hath been born a son, the like of whom there is none, and his nature is not like man’s nature, and the colour of his body is whiter than snow and redder than the bloom of a rose, and the hair of his head is whiter than white wool, and his eyes are like the rays of the sun,\f + \fr \reference : \ft Borrowed by Apoc. Petri.\f* and he opened his eyes and thereupon lighted up the whole house. (quod natus est filio suo [nomine] Lamech cui oculi sunt sicut radi solis capilli[s] eiuscandidiores septies niue, corpori autem eius nemo hominum potest intueri | that he gave birth to his son [name] Lamech, whose eyes are like the rays of the sun’s hair [seven times] brighter than his snow, but no man can look at his body)L
\v 11 And he arose in the hands of the midwife, and opened his mouth and blessed the Lord of heaven.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Here only in Enoch. But note Lat. = 'dominum viventem in saecula.' Also cf. v. 1.\f* (et surexit inter manus obstetricis suae eadem hora, qua procidit de utero matris suae, orauit dominum uiuentem in secula et laudauit. | And he rose up in the hands of his midwife at the same hour that he came out of his mother's womb, prayed and praised the Lord who lives forever.)L
\v 12 And his father Lamech became afraid and fled to me, and did not believe that he was sprung from him, but that he was in the likeness of the angels of heaven; and behold I have come to thee that thou mayst make known to me the truth.’ (et timuit Lamech. | And Lamech was afraid.)L
\v 13 And I, Enoch, answered and said unto him: ‘The Lord will do a new thing\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Num 16:30\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Isa 43:19\x* on the earth, and this I have already seen in a vision, and make known to thee that in the generation of my father Jared some of the angels of heaven transgressed the word of the Lord. (et dixit Enoc: nontiatum esi mihi fili quia post quingentos annos | And Enoch said: 'You have been informed my son that after five hundred years)L
\v 14 And behold they commit sin and transgress the law, and have united themselves with women and commit sin with them, and have married some of them, and have begot children by them.
\v 17 And they shall produce on the earth giants not according to the spirit, but according to the flesh, and there shall be a great punishment on the earth, and the earth shall be cleansed from all impurity.
\v 15 Yea, there shall come a great destruction over the whole earth, and there shall be a deluge and a great destruction for one year.\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Gen 7:11\x*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Gen 8:14\x* (mittel deus cataclismum aquae ut deleat omnem creaturam [xl.] ostendit oculis nostris. | God shows the cataclysm of water to destroy all creation [xl.] before our eyes.)L
\v 16 And this son who has been born unto you shall be left on the earth, and his three children shall be saved with him: when all mankind that are on the earth shall die [he and his sons shall be saved]. (et erunt illi • III • filii [et erunt nomina filiorum cius • Sem • Cham • Iafeth] | and they will be • 3 • sons [and the names of the sons will be Cius • Shem • Ham • Japheth])L
\v 18 And now make known to thy son Lamech that he who has been born is in truth his son, and call his name Noah; for he shall be left to you, and he and his sons shall be saved from the destruction, which shall come upon the earth on account of all the sin and all the unrighteousness, which shall be consummated on the earth in his days. (et ipse uocabitur Noe qui interpretatur requies quia requiem prestabit in archam. | and he himself will be called Noah, which is interpreted as rest, because he will provide rest in the ark.)L
\v 19 And after that there shall be still more unrighteousness than that which was first consummated on the earth; for I know the mysteries of the holy ones;\f + \fr \reference : \ft Either the secrets known to the angels, or the secrets relating to the righteous in the future.\f* for He, the Lord, has showed me and informed me, and I have read (them) in the heavenly tablets.

\v 1 And I saw written on them that generation upon generation shall transgress, till\f + \fr \reference : \ft t,β: 'that' g1gmq\f* a generation of righteousness arises, and transgression is destroyed and sin passes away from the earth, and all manner of good comes upon it.\f + \fr \reference : \ft The fresh growth of sin after the Deluge: its destruction and the advent of the Messianic kingdom.\f*
\v 2 And now, my son, go and make known to thy son Lamech that this son, which has been born, is in truth his son, and that (this) is no lie.’
\v 3 And when Methuselah had heard the words of his father Enoch—for he had shown to him everything in secret\f + \fr \reference : \ft ɑ: 'every secret thing' β.\f*—he returned and showed (them) to him and called the name of that son Noah; for he will comfort the earth after all the destruction.\f + \fr \reference : \ft The meaning of the name Noah given in Gen. v. 29 is here repeated.\f*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  Gen 5:29\x*

\v 1 \f + \fr \reference : \ft This final chapter forms an independent addition. The writer is acquainted with i-xxxvi and xci-civ, or at least with parts of those sections. But his acquaintance with i-xxxvi is very inaccurate. What in chapters xviii and xxi was the place of punishment for the disobedient stars becomes in cviii. 3-6 practically Gehenna. Note the Essene tone of this chapter, the high honour paid to asceticism, the scorn of silver and gold in 8-10, the blessed immortality of the soul but apparently not of the body, and the duration of light and darkness so prominent in 11-14. This chapter is more akin to xci-civ than any other in the book. Its object is to encourage the righteous still to hope on despite the long delay in the coming of the kingdom.\f* Another book which Enoch wrote for his son Methuselah and for those who will come after him, and keep the law in the last days.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Contrast 'fall away from the law', xcix. 2.\f*
\v 2 Ye who have done good shall wait for those days till an end is made of those who work evil, and an end of the might of the transgressors.\f + \fr \reference : \ft The faithful are exhorted to further patience.\f*
\v 3 And wait ye indeed till sin has passed away, for their names shall be blotted out of the book of life and out of the holy books, and their seed shall be destroyed for ever, and their spirits shall be slain,\f + \fr \reference : \ft Cf. xxii. 13; xcix. 11 (note). It does not imply annihilation as the victims still 'cry and make lamentation'.\f* and they shall cry and make lamentation in a place\f + \fr \reference : \ft This chaotic flaming hell beyond the limits of the earth is the place of punishment for the angels in xviii. 12-16; xxi. 1-7.\f* that is a chaotic\f + \fr \reference : \ft Eth. αόρατος, the LXX rendering of תהו in Gen. i. 2.\f*\x + \xo \reference : \xt  [Gen 1:2]\x* wilderness, and in the fire shall they burn; for there is no earth there.
\v 4 And I saw there something like an invisible cloud; for by reason of its depth I could not †look over†,\f + \fr \reference : \ft We might emend to 'behold its height' or 'tell its circuit' (or 'size').\f* and I saw a flame of fire blazing brightly, and things like shining mountains circling and sweeping to and fro.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Further description of this hell and its inhabitants in terms borrowed from xviii. 13; xxi. 3.\f*
\v 5 And I asked one of the holy angels\f + \fr \reference : \ft This phrase is borrowed from i-xxxvi: cf. xxvii. 2.\f* who was with me and said unto him: ‘What is this shining thing? for it is not a heaven but only the flame of a blazing fire, and the voice\f + \fr \reference : \ft Cf. xviii. 13.\f* of weeping and crying\f + \fr \reference : \ft ɑ: လ β.\f* and lamentation and strong pain.’
\v 6 And he said unto me: ‘This place which thou seest—here are cast the spirits of sinners and blasphemers,\f + \fr \reference : \ft Cf. xci. 7.\f* and of those who work wickedness, and of those who pervert everything that the Lord hath spoken\f + \fr \reference : \ft mtu, β: 'done' g1gq.\f* through the mouth of the prophets\f + \fr \reference : \ft Here only expressly mentioned in Enoch.\f*—(even) the things that shall be.\f + \fr \reference : \ft This hell which is outside the earth is the final place of punishment for sinners and blasphemers and perverters of God's revelation through the prophets. In vv. 3-6 the writer has confounded places (i.e. Gehenna, and the hell of the disobedient stars) that are most carefully distinguished in i-xxxvi, and yet he has borrowed the phraseology of that section.\f*
\v 7 For some of them are written and inscribed above in the heaven, in order that the angels may read them and know that which shall befall the sinners, and the spirits of the humble, and of those who have afflicted their bodies, and been recompensed by God; and of those who have been put to shame by wicked men:\f + \fr \reference : \ft refers to the heavenly tablets. Cf. xlvii. 3. These records are also called the books of the holy ones, for their purpose is to let the angels know of the future: cf. ciii. 2. See also Asc. Isa. vii. 27.\f*\f + \fr \reference : \ft 7-9. The  עננים. and עברים of the Psalms. They constitute the true Israel as opposed to the proud, the selfish and the paganizers. Cf.

\v 8 Who love God and loved neither gold nor silver nor any of the good things which are in the world,\x + \xo \reference : \xt  [1John 2:15]\x* but gave over their bodies to torture.
\v 9 Who, since they came into being, longed not after earthly food,\f + \fr \reference : \ft 'those who have afflicted their bodies . . . loved neither gold nor silver . . . longed not after earthly food. These phrases would apply well to the Essene party. Cf. xlviii. 7, cii. 5. These marks of the righteous have their counterpart in those of the wicked: cf. xcvi. 5-7, xcvii. 8-10, xcviii. 2.\f* but regarded everything as a passing breath, and lived accordingly, and the Lord tried them much, and their spirits were found pure so that they should bless His name.
\v 10 And all the blessings destined for them I have recounted in the books. And He hath assigned them their recompense, because they have been found to be such as loved heaven more than their life in the world, and though they were trodden under foot of wicked men, and experienced abuse and reviling from them and were put to shame, yet they blessed Me.\f + \fr \reference : \ft Enoch speaks, and refers his hearers and readers to his books.\f*

Or we might render 'into shining light'. Cf. 2 En. xxii. 8-10, the garments of the blessed are composed of God's glory. In 1 En. lxii. 16, they are 'garments of life'.
